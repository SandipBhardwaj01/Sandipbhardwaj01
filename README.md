## About me
I develop end-to-end web applications and data pipelines that help businesses make faster, smarter decisions. For example, I built a 100% dynamic web platform to streamline project management for real-estate developers — adding features to manage construction projects, track material usage, monitor site progress, and improving client communications by **~90%**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
